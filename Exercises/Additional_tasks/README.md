# Additional task
1. Write the sequence of instructions in the ARM assembly language that increments the 32-bit STEV1 variable 5 times without the use of multiplication command. Solve the task by indirect base addressing without immediate offset through the register R0.

TIP:  multiplying the number by 5 is the same as 5 additions.

2. Reserve the space for a table labeled TABLE with enough space for 4 32-bit values. Then write in TABLE the memory addresses of these 4 operands. Resolve the task by indirect addressing with immediate offset through the register R0.

3. Write the sequence of instructions in the ARM assembly language, which sums up the 5 16-bit values defined with the label TABLE: "1,2,3,4,5"  and stores the result in a 32-bit variable SUM. Resolve the task by indirect addressing with immediate offset through the register R0.
