# Task 3
1. Write down the instruction for the ARM processor, which loads the constant 128 in the R1 register. Use Immmediate Addressing (MOV instruction). Determine the appropriate machine instruction (32 - bit number in hexadecimal form). Run the program step by step and observe the content of the R15 (PC) and R1 registers. What are their values ​​at the end of the program?

2. Write down the instructions for the ARM processor, which loads the variable value in the register R1:

    a) Load 32-bit value 0x12345678 into register R1

    b) loads the 8-bit value 128 into the R1 register.

    c) upload 16-bit value 0xF123 to register R1

Resolve tasks with indirect (base) addressing without offset through register R0.

3. Write the sequence of instructions in the ARM processor assembly language that overwrites the 32-bit STEV1 variable to the 32-bit STEV2 variable. Solve the task also if the STEV1 and STEV2 variables are 8-bit or 16-bit. Solve all cases with indirect (base) addressing without offset through register R0.
