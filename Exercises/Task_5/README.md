# Task 5
1. Write the sequence of instructions for the ARM processor, which sums the 32-bit STEV1 and STEV2 variables and writes the result to the 32-bit REZ variable. Repeat the task for the case when the STEV2 variable is subtracted from the STEV1 variable. Also make variations for adding and subtracting 16-bit and 8-bit variables. STEV1 and STEV2 should have initial values ​​10 (10) and 5 (10) in succession, and always only reserve the space for variable REZ.



2. Write the sequence of instructionss for the ARM processor, which calculates the expression STEV1 = STEV2 + STEV3-STEV1, where STEV1, STEV2, and STEV3 are 32-bit variables with initial values ​​(define them with pseudo-ininstructions): STEV1 = 50 (16) , STEV2 = 100 (10), STEV3 = 2F (16).



3. Write down the instructions(s) for the ARM processor that load the values in registers:

    a) Unsigned load of 32-bit value 0x12345678 into register R1.

    b) Unsigned load of  8-bit value 128 into the R2 register.

    c) Signed load of  8-bit value 128 in the R3 register.

    d) Unsigned load of 16-bit value of 0xF123 to the R4 register.

    e) Signed load of 16-bit 0xF123 value in the R5 register.



Solve all cases by indirect addressing through the base register R0.
