# Task 6
1. Write command sequences in the ARM processor compiler that compute the expression STEV1 = STEV1 + STEV2 if:
a) STEV1 and STEV2 are 8-bit unsigned variables with initial values of 15 (10) and 130 (10).
b) STEV1 and STEV2 are 8-bit pre-determined variables with initial values 15 (10) and 130 (10).
c) STEV1 is a 32-bit variable and STEV2 is an 8-bit pre-determined variable. The initial values are: STEV1 = 128 (10), STEV2 = 128 (10).

Solve all cases by indirect addressing via the R0 register.
